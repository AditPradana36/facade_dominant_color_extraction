# facade_dominant_color_extraction
This script extracts the dominant facade colors of buildings based on Street-View Imagery (SVI). Building facades are segmented using a pre-trained model. The color scheme used for analysis is HSV, where H represents Hue (0–179), S is Saturation (0–1), and V is Value (0–1).
